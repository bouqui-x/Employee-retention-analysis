# Employee Retention Analysis - Key Findings Summary

## Executive Summary

This analysis examined employee retention data from 14,999 employees to identify factors contributing to turnover and build a predictive model for HR decision-making.

## Data Analysis Completed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Identified key variables impacting employee retention:
   - Satisfaction level (strongest predictor)
   - Salary level
   - Average monthly hours
   - Number of projects
   - Time spent at company
   - Promotion history

### 2. Salary Impact Analysis
✅ Created bar chart visualization showing:
   - **Low salary**: Higher employee turnover
   - **High salary**: Better employee retention
   - Clear positive correlation between compensation and retention

### 3. Department Analysis
✅ Created bar chart showing retention by department:
   - Sales and Support departments show higher turnover rates
   - Different departments require tailored retention strategies

### 4. Logistic Regression Model
✅ Built and trained model using key features:
   - Features selected based on EDA insights
   - Categorical variables (salary) converted using one-hot encoding
   - Data split: 80% training, 20% testing

### 5. Model Performance
✅ Achieved strong results:
   - **Overall Accuracy**: 76%
   - **Precision (Stayed)**: 80%
   - **Recall (Stayed)**: 92%
   - **F1-Score (Stayed)**: 85%

## Key Insights

### What Makes Employees Leave?

1. **Low Satisfaction** (Primary Factor)
   - Strongest negative relationship with retention
   - HR should prioritize employee satisfaction surveys and action plans

2. **Low Compensation**
   - Clear correlation: low salary → high turnover
   - Competitive pay is crucial for retention

3. **Long Tenure Without Growth**
   - Employees with more time at company are more likely to leave
   - Indicates career stagnation
   - Need for clear career progression paths

4. **Department-Specific Issues**
   - Sales and Support face unique challenges
   - Require targeted retention strategies

## Recommendations for HR

### Immediate Actions

1. **Conduct Regular Satisfaction Surveys**
   - Monitor satisfaction levels closely
   - Address issues proactively

2. **Review Compensation Strategy**
   - Benchmark salaries against market
   - Consider salary adjustments for at-risk employees

3. **Career Development Programs**
   - Create clear advancement paths
   - Offer training and development opportunities
   - Regular promotion reviews

4. **Department-Specific Interventions**
   - Focus on Sales and Support departments
   - Understand unique challenges
   - Implement tailored solutions

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Use the model to identify at-risk employees
   - Proactive intervention before resignation

2. **Work-Life Balance**
   - Monitor average monthly hours
   - Ensure reasonable project loads

3. **Recognition Programs**
   - Increase promotion opportunities
   - Acknowledge long-term employees

## Model Limitations

- **Class Imbalance**: More "stayed" than "left" employees
  - Model better at predicting who stays
  - Lower performance for predicting turnover

- **Feature Scope**: May benefit from additional features:
  - Manager relationship quality
  - Commute distance
  - Work flexibility
  - Team dynamics

## Next Steps

1. **Model Improvement**
   - Try ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Address class imbalance with SMOTE
   - Feature engineering

2. **Deployment**
   - Create dashboard for HR team
   - Monthly at-risk employee reports
   - Integration with HR systems

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Regular model retraining
   - Performance tracking
   - Feedback incorporation

## Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical salary variable to dummy variables
- No missing values handled (dataset was clean)
- Selected 7 key features for model

### Model Configuration
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Max iterations: 1000
- Train-test split: 80-20
- Random state: 42 (for reproducibility)
